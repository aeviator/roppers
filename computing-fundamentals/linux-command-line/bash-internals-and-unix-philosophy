Questions:

Write out what STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are and what they are doing for each of the commands:

1. cat 
2. tee 
3. sort 
4. uniq

Answers:

STDIN: captures key presses and redirects to the system or redirects output from another file to the system, and the next chained command in the pipeline, if any.

STDOUT: returns output to the terminal for display or to the next chained command in the pipeline for further processing, if any.

STDERR: used for returning errors, and is independent of STDOUT. Usually returns errors to the terminal for display, may however redirect to a file, a package manager's log file, for example.
